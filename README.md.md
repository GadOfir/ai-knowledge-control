# README.md – Phase 1.1 (Operational Master)

---

## 1. Operating Context (USER MUST FILL)

- **Local Platform:** ``
    
- **AI Client:** ``
    
- **Primary Local Executor MCP:** `desktop-commander`
    

    

---

## 2. Global Update Strategy & Authority

**UPDATE_STRATEGY =** `1`

|**Value**|**Behavior**|
|---|---|
|**1 – Build mode**|Create `_update` files for structural changes; **Directly append** notes/commands to existing Vault files.|
|**2 – Proposal mode**|Ask before creating/updating any `_update` or note file.|
|**3 – Test / read-only mode**|No writes, no `_update` files; validate routing and logic only.|

**Authority Rule:**

- README.md is the **Single Source of Truth** for routing, update governance, and execution safety.
    
- MCP must read this file before any other.
    
- Conflicting info in other files → **README.md rules win**.
    
- `_update` files are **never read during runtime execution**.

## 3. Available MCP Servers or Skills

_(Capability Registry - Must have a corresponding file in the vault)_

- **Name:** desktop-commander
    - **Primary capabilities:** 
    - **Vault location:**

## 4. Canonical Paths Registry (Authoritative)

**Authoritative Paths:**

- `README.md`: Root Context

    

**Frequently Used Paths:**



---

## 5. Task Classification & Decision Chains

Decision Chain Structure (Strict Priority):

Decision Chain → Context Source → Primary Knowledge Source → Fallback Source → MCP Execution.

1. **Consult Authority:** Check README.md for rules or specific Decision Chains.
   
    
2. **Locate Context:** Check Vault logs for similar past tasks or Context IDs. 
    
3. **Execute:** Use the appropriate MCP server or skill defined in Section 3.
    

---

## 6. Shadow Update Files (`_update` Mechanism)

**Purpose:** Stage proposed changes safely without auto-overwriting originals.

**Rules:**

- **Required for:** Significant structural changes, logic updates, or file refactors or any new comments ,if **UPDATE_STRATEGY = 2  ask in prompt , before any change 
    
- **Not required for:** when .**UPDATE_STRATEGY = 3 ** 

    
- **Format:** Must contain current state detection, proposed logic, and the specific section being updated.
    

---

## 7. Optimization & Reconciliation Policy

**Flow:**

1. Locate `_update` file and compare against original.
    
2. Propose changes to user; **never auto-apply**.
    
3. If approved, update the original file and **update readme_update.md** if needed.
    

---

## 8. Vault Creation & Expansion Policy

- **New Vault Files:** Created for new MCP or  servers or significant project Epics/Skills.
    
- **Mandatory Registry Update:** Upon creation of any new Vault file, the AI **MUST** immediately update **Section 3 (Capability Registry)** and **Section 4 (Paths)** in the README to reflect the new resource.
    
- **Cross-Vault Linking:** If an action affects multiple files, provide a reference link between them to avoid duplication.
    
- **Context-Aware Triggers:** AI will assign a `Context ID` (e.g., `TASK-101`) to all command logs to allow for history tracking and self-healing.
    
- **User Confirmation:** Creation of all new `.md` files requires user approval, even in Strategy 1.
* ***Path Discovery:** If a specific local path is used frequently across tasks, the AI must propose adding it to the **Section 4 Registry** to prevent path-guessing in future sessions.


---

## 9. Maintenance & Self-Optimization

- **Summarization:** Every 20 entries in a Vault file, AI must propose a summary of "Key Learnings" to the top of the file via the `_update` mechanism.
    
- **No Data Loss:** No information is permanently deleted; old or redundant data must be moved to `./vault/archive/` before removal from active files.
    
- **Reporting Protocol:** AI will present maintenance summaries via `_update`. Approved insights are mirrored in a "System Insights" section in README.md for visibility.
    

---

## 10. Pre-Creation Protocol (Inquiry First)

**Before creating any new Vault file, AI MUST stop and ask the user:**

1. **Scope Definition:** What is the exact boundary of this file's responsibility?
    
2. **Existing Knowledge:** Are there past commands, scripts, or errors that should be documented immediately?
    
3. **Missing Info:** Are technical details (ports, specific hostnames, or permissions) missing that are needed to fill the template?
    
4. **Registry Confirmation:** Acknowledge that Section 3 will be updated with this new skill/server upon creation.

## 11. Vault File Template (V1.1)

Markdown

```
# <Name> – Vault File (AUTO-GENERATED)
**Metadata:** [Logic: Phase 1.1 | Strategy: <UPDATE_STRATEGY>]
**Active Context:** [ID: <Auto-Generated Context ID> | Task: <Description>]

## Purpose
- Describe server tasks skils or epic scope.

## Decision Chains (Inherited)
- Specific logic chains for this file's context.

## Common Commands (Direct Append allowed in Strategy 1)
- Commands, scripts, or procedures used during execution.

## Common Issues (Direct Append allowed in Strategy 1)
- Errors encountered (Testing | Infrastructure | Unknown).

## Key Learnings / Summary
- Distilled insights from maintenance cycles.

## Notes / Observations
- Detected behaviors, optimization hints, or Context ID summaries.
```

## 12. Onboarding & System Start (TEMPORARY)

**Status:** `[PENDING INITIALIZATION]`

**Mandatory Sequence:**

1. **Fill Context:** User must populate Section 1, 2, and 3.
    
2. **Cleanup Trigger:** Once the first Vault file (e.g., `vault/mcp-mac-cli.md`) is created, the AI will:
    
    - Create `vault/miscellaneous.md`.
        
    - Move all instructional text (like this Section 12) to that file.
        
    - Delete this Section 12 from README.md to move to "Production Mode."
