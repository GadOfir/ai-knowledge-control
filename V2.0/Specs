i have this readme that i created , its becuoming to havy i think i shuld re write it and kepp only the fetures that are strong 

re order and optmize them 


Improve:
Global Update Strategy > simplfy for just 2
Global Update Strategy -  
user will be able to work and files will be created in bacground for him per UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 
no new files will writen in the bacground if the user wants AI will ask the user if to change from  UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 to UPDATE_STRATEGY = 2


what do we need:

2.fix the user entry point with readme file > make it more leaner , you need to say you want to use your folder 
executian prompt shuld be the first thing the AI sees
3.


high level:

Global Update Strategy -  
user will be able to work and files will be created in bacground for him per UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 
no new files will writen in the bacground if the user wants AI will ask the user if to change from  UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 to UPDATE_STRATEGY = 2

remove: System Status & Lifecycle

simplfy it


priority:
1. lets think of a prioirty for each feture

create a mechinesim to prioteze onboadring stuff first if onboarding
and if on prodaction it will first look at prod stuff

UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 (Build/Stage mode)
SYSTEM_STATUS = TEMPLATE (see Section 8)


2. simpfy temaplate 
make sure it will only have one temaplte stracture for both 

for porjects only 

# Vault File (AUTO-GENERATED)

Metadata: [Type: Skill | Project | Strategy: {{UPDATE_STRATEGY}}]  
Active Context: [CID: {{Registry ID}} | Task: {{Current Operation Description}}]

RULE: Use {{OPTIONAL_INPUT}} for undecided fields or leave blank. Add only when information is solid and not speculative.

## Execution Prompt (Copy & Use)

- Authority: README.md | Update Strategy: Inherited
- Rules: **STAGING ONLY**. Do not write to original files.
- Task: {{DESCRIBE GOAL}}
- Expected Output: A staged `_update` file containing actions/logs for user revie

## Project File Registry (For Project Type Only)


slef healing:

1. make sure CIDs are ok and fix if not 
2. optmize temaplte files on the fly , 
3. excutain promt opmtzisen


vault Expansion & Autonomy Policy (Growth Control Rules)
Data & Skill Files: Requires individual user confirmation and Registry entry for every file
Project Autonomy: Requires confirmation for the Project Root Folder and Index File only.
Local Freedom: Inside an approved Project Folder, the AI may create sub-folders and files (logs, artifacts) without individual Registry entries, provided they are linked in the Project Index.
Root has only README.md; project files/data types are created in folders named after the project


4. Shadow Staging & Reconciliation

Staging: Create filename_update.md for ANY change to vault content.

Reconciliation: Compare _update with original → Propose to user → Apply only after approval.
Cleanup: Delete _update files immediately after successful reconciliation


Unified Execution Brain (Routing & Growth)
Phase A: Routing (Decision Chain)
Consult R01: Establish global rules and current strategy.
Locate Context: Search Section 2 Registry for CIDs whose Purpose/Capability matches the user's request
Validate CID Structure:
Skill/Project CIDs: Must have Execution Prompt section
Data CIDs: Must have Authority declaration
If malformed: Report error to user, suggest fixing CID or removing from Registry
Execute: If valid, open that file, read its Execution Prompt, and follow those instructions combined with global rules
Phase B: Growth (Pre-Creation Protocol)
If no relevant CID is found, follow this protocol:

Inquiry: Ask the user for scope and existing knowledge to be captured.
Missing Info: Identify missing technical details (ports, hostnames, permissions).
Registry Proposal: Propose a new CID, Type, and Path for Section 2.


Execution Prompt (Runtime Authority

Authority: README.md is the Single Source of Truth , unless i ask you not to use it 

System Status: TEMPLATE (awaiting onboarding) - need to think abot this moore 
Update Strategy: 1 (Build/Stage mode) - this is ok

Safety: The AI is FORBIDDEN from writing to original files directly  - need to think abot this moore
