System Overview (What This System Is)
This repository is a routing-first, capability-controlled Obsidian Knowledge Vault. It ensures all AI actions are deterministic and safe through strict data typing (Data, Skill, Project).

[!INFO] Why?
By categorizing knowledge, the AI never guesses which rules to follow. It knows whether it's reading reference facts (Data), step-by-step procedures (Skill), or active work tracking (Project).

Execution Prompt (Runtime Authority)


. Global Update Strategy & Authority (Write Permission Modes)
