Improve:
Global Update Strategy > simplfy for just 2
Global Update Strategy -  
user will be able to work and files will be created in bacground for him per UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 
no new files will writen in the bacground if the user wants AI will ask the user if to change from  UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 to UPDATE_STRATEGY = 2


what do we need:

2.fix the user entry point with readme file > make it more leaner , you need to say you want to use your folder 
executian prompt shuld be the first thing the AI sees
3.


high level:

Global Update Strategy -  
user will be able to work and files will be created in bacground for him per UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 
no new files will writen in the bacground if the user wants AI will ask the user if to change from  UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 to UPDATE_STRATEGY = 2



priority:
1. lets think of a prioirty for each feture

create a mechinesim to prioteze onboadring stuff first if onboarding
and if on prodaction it will first look at prod stuff

UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1 (Build/Stage mode)
SYSTEM_STATUS = TEMPLATE (see Section 8)


what we have now

System Overview (What This System Is)
This repository is a routing-first, capability-controlled Obsidian Knowledge Vault. It ensures all AI actions are deterministic and safe through strict data typing (Data, Skill, Project).

[!INFO] Why?
By categorizing knowledge, the AI never guesses which rules to follow. It knows whether it's reading reference facts (Data), step-by-step procedures (Skill), or active work tracking (Project).

Execution Prompt (Runtime Authority)


. Global Update Strategy & Authority (Write Permission Modes)

2. Master Vault Registry (Index & Paths)
