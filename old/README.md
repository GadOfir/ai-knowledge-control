System Overview (Authority & Scope)

This repository is a routing-first, capability-controlled Obsidian Knowledge Vault. It ensures all AI actions are deterministic and safe through strict data typing (Data, Skill, Project).

[!INFO] Why? > By categorizing knowledge, the AI never guesses which rules to follow; it knows if it's looking at a "How-to" (Skill) or a "Working Draft" (Project).

Execution Prompt (Runtime Authority)

You are operating inside a capability-controlled Obsidian Knowledge Vault.
Authority: README.md is the Single Source of Truth.

Safety: The AI is FORBIDDEN from writing to original files directly.
Protocol: All changes (Logs, Notes, Logic) MUST be staged in _update files and approved by the user before merging.

1. Global Update Strategy & Authority

UPDATE_STRATEGY = 1

| Value | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 – Build | Stage ALL data (Notes, Logs, Structure) in _update files for user review. |
| 2 – Proposal | Ask for permission before even creating an _update file. |
| 3 – Read-Only | No writes allowed; validate routing and logic only. |

2. Master Vault Registry (Index & Paths)

The AI must maintain this table. Any file/container not listed here is "Invisible" to the system.

| CID | Name | Type | Capability / Purpose | Authoritative Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R01 | README | Logic | System Authority & Routing | README.md |
| S01 | powershell-commander | Skill | Command execution & process management | vault/powershell-commander.md |
| D01 | environments | Data | API credentials & PFX paths | vault/environments.md |
| P01 | platformtoken | Project | API testing with certificate auth | projects/platformtoken/ |

3. Unified Execution Brain (Routing & Growth)

Phase A: Routing (Decision Chain)
- Consult R01: Establish global rules and current strategy.
- Locate Context: Search Section 2 for existing CIDs matching the task.
- Execute: If found, use the approved file's Execution Prompt.

Phase B: Growth (Pre-Creation Protocol)
If no relevant CID is found, follow this protocol:
- Inquiry: Ask the user for scope and existing knowledge to be captured.
- Missing Info: Identify missing technical details (ports, hostnames, permissions).
- Registry Proposal: Propose a new CID, Type, and Path for Section 2.

4. Shadow Staging & Reconciliation (Strict Safety)

- Staging: Create filename_update.md for ANY change (Logic, Logs, or Notes).
- No Direct Writing: The AI will never modify an original file without a staged proposal.
- Reconciliation: Compare _update with original → Propose to user → Apply only after approval.
- Cleanup: Delete _update files immediately after successful reconciliation.

5. Vault Expansion & Autonomy Policy

- Data & Skill Files: Requires individual user confirmation and Registry entry for every file.
- Project Autonomy: Requires confirmation for the Project Root Folder and Index File only.
- Local Freedom: Inside an approved Project Folder, the AI may create sub-folders and files (logs, artifacts) without individual Registry entries, provided they are linked in the Project Index.

6. Maintenance & Self-Healing

- Summarization: Every 20 entries → propose summary via _update.
- Self-Healing: Periodically verify that all Registry CIDs match file metadata.
- Path Repair: If a file is moved, use the CID to find it and update Section 2.

7. Vault File Template (V1.3)

# <Name> – Vault File (AUTO-GENERATED)

Metadata: [Type: Data | Skill | Project | Strategy: <UPDATE_STRATEGY>]
Active Context: [ID: | Task: ]

Execution Prompt (Copy & Use)
- Authority: README.md | Update Strategy: Inherited
- Rules: STAGING ONLY. Do not write to original files.
- Task:
- Expected Output: A staged _update file containing actions/logs for user review.
