1. Merge Section 3 and Section 4
Currently, you have a "Capability Registry" (Section 3) and a "Paths Registry" (Section 4). This is double work.

The Improvement: Combine them into one Master Map. Every file gets one row that contains its Name, Type, and Path.

Why: The AI only has to look at, and update, one table instead of two.

2. The "Handshake" Protocol (Update Section 10)
To ensure the Registry stays updated without you doing it, you must make it a legal requirement for the AI's "Write" process.

The Improvement: Change your Pre-Creation Protocol to include: "AI must provide the updated Registry table row BEFORE the user approves the new file."

Why: This ensures the Registry is never "forgotten." It becomes part of the file creation "cost."

3. Use "Context IDs" (CIDs)
In a standard Markdown vault, paths can get long (e.g., [[vault/projects/active/testing_phase_1]]).

The Improvement: Assign a short ID (like P01, S01) in the Registry.

Why: You and the AI can use these IDs to quickly reference files in notes (e.g., "See [[P01]] for details"). It acts as a "Shortlink."

What this looks like in your README:
I recommend replacing your current Section 3 and 4 with this consolidated version:

Markdown

## 3. Master Vault Registry (Index & Paths)
| ID | Name | Type | Capability / Purpose | Path |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| R01 | README | Logic | System Authority & Routing | `README.md` |
| S01 | [Skill Name] | Skill | [What it does] | `vault/skills/...` |

## 4. (Removed - Merged into Section 3)
And updating Section 10 (Pre-Creation):
Markdown

## 10. Pre-Creation Protocol
Before creating any new vault file, AI MUST:
1. Propose the **Scope** and **Missing Info**.
2. Propose the **Registry Row** (ID, Name, Type, Path) to be added to Section 3.
3. Wait for User Confirmation.
Does this "Low-Tech" approach feel more aligned with how you want to use Obsidian? If so, I can provide the specific text to swap into your README.
