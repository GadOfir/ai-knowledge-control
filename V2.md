# README.md – System Operational Master

## System Overview (Authority & Scope)

This repository is a **routing-first, capability-controlled Obsidian Knowledge Vault**. It ensures all AI actions are deterministic and safe through strict data typing (Data, Skill, Project).

---

## Execution Prompt (Runtime Authority)

**You are operating inside a capability-controlled Obsidian Knowledge Vault**.

- **Authority:** `README.md` is the Single Source of Truth.
    
- **Safety:** `_update` files are staging-only; NEVER execute them at runtime.
    
- **Constraint:** Creation of new vault files ALWAYS requires explicit user confirmation.

## 1. Global Update Strategy & Authority

**UPDATE_STRATEGY =** `1`

|**Value**|**Behavior**|
|---|---|
|**1 – Build**|Create `_update` files for structure; append notes to existing files.|
|**2 – Proposal**|Ask before creating `_update` files or appending notes.|
|**3 – Test / Read-Only**|No writes; validate routing and logic only.|

---

## 2. Master Vault Registry (Index & Paths)

_The AI must maintain this table. Any file/container not listed here is "Invisible" to the system._

|**CID**|**Name**|**Type**|**Capability / Purpose**|**Authoritative Path**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**R01**|README|Logic|System Authority & Routing|`README.md`|

---

## 3. Unified Execution Brain (Routing & Growth)

**Phase A: Routing (Decision Chain)**

1. **Consult R01:** Establish global rules and current strategy.
    
2. **Locate Context:** Search Section 2 for existing CIDs matching the task.
    
3. **Execute:** If found, use the approved file's Execution Prompt.
    

Phase B: Growth (Pre-Creation Protocol)

If no relevant CID is found in Section 2, the AI MUST follow this protocol:

1. **Inquiry:** Ask the user for scope and existing knowledge to be captured.
    
2. **Missing Info:** Identify what data is still needed before a file can be built.
    
3. **Registry Proposal:** Propose a new CID, Type, and Path for Section 2.

## 4. Shadow Staging & Reconciliation

- **Staging:** Create `filename_update.md` for structural changes or logic refactors.
    
- **Reconciliation:** Compare `_update` with original → Propose to user → Apply only after approval.
    
- **Cleanup:** Delete `_update` files immediately after successful reconciliation.
    
- **Prompt Quality:** Verify any new prompt against the Quality Checklist (Clarity, Safety, Completeness).
    

---

## 5. Vault Expansion & Autonomy Policy

- **Individual Files (Data/Skill):** Requires individual confirmation and Registry entry for every file.
    
- **Project Containers:** Requires confirmation for the **Project Root Folder** and **Index File** only.
    
- **Local Freedom:** Inside an approved Project Folder, the AI may create sub-folders and sub-files (logs, artifacts) without individual Registry entries, provided they are linked in the Project Index.
    

---

## 6. Maintenance & Self-Healing

- **Summarization:** Every 20 entries → propose summary via `_update`.
    
- **Self-Healing:** Periodically verify that all Registry CIDs match file metadata.
    
- **Path Repair:** If a file is moved, use the CID to find it and update Section 2.

## 7. Vault File Template (V1.2)

_All files MUST use this structure to enable Self-Healing and Routing._

# <Name> – Vault File (AUTO-GENERATED)

Metadata: [Type: Data | Skill | Project | Strategy: <UPDATE_STRATEGY>]

Active Context: [ID: <Context ID> | Task: <Description>]

## Execution Prompt (Copy & Use)

- Authority: README.md | Update Strategy: Inherited
    
- Rules: Follow Decision Chain; Ask before creating new files.
    
- Task: <DESCRIBE GOAL>
    
- Expected Output: Actions taken, Logs, Clear next steps.

## [SYSTEM STATE: PENDING INITIALIZATION]

- **Environment:** Platform: `<INPUT>` | Client: `<INPUT>`
    
- **Onboarding:** Once the first file is created, move this section to `vault/miscellaneous.md` and enter **Production Mode**.
